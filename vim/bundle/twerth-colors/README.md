# twerth vim color schemes

I wanted a nice way to hook [twerth's colorschemes](https://github.com/twerth) into [tpope's pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), while using [tsaleh's update bundle script](http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen).

Maybe there's a better way to do this, but I don't know.
